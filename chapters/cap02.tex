\chapter{State of the art}\label{cap:conceptual}

The literature review for the development of this project was carried out by researching projects that were similar to this one in some aspects, such as the receipt, storage, and processing of \gls{IoT} sensor data, and real-time information transmission.

\section{Data storage and big data}

In the context of data storage and big data, the importance of managing and analyzing large data sets has been emphasized in various studies. One of these studies is the work on the \gls{FQC}, a software designed to manage information from FASTQ files ~\cite{fqc2017}. Developed in Python and JavaScript, the \gls{FQC} aggregates data and generates metrics that are displayed on a dashboard. The software is capable of processing single-end or paired data, and can process batch files based on a specified directory.

It is important to note that the software allows customization, users can configure \gls{kpi}, charts, and other dashboard elements. The data processing layer of the \gls{FQC} bears similarities with industrial sensor monitoring systems of this dissertation, mainly in aspects of data access and processing. It operates by accessing a directory, processing the information, and making it available for later use, and also supports the execution of small batch functions.

The dashboard built by the FQC offers a variety of visualizations, including line charts, bar charts, and heat maps, among others. These visualizations are dynamically generated and can be configured using \gls{json} files \cite{mdnJson}, providing a flexible and user-friendly interface for data management and analysis.

Another contribution to the field of data storage and big data is the work of Ren et al. \cite{ren2021data}, which focuses on predicting product quality through a data-driven approach. The \gls{KPIs} are identified to serve as highly relevant state variables for product quality. Traditionally, these variables are measured through offline laboratory analyses, which introduces latency into the system.

The \gls{AI} component of the system is layered, where the lower layer deals with both categorized and uncategorized data to train and test the AI models. A Gaussian distribution is applied in the second layer to process the data, which are then fed into a semi-supervised training layer. The final layer provides the results of the predictions, thus closing the cycle.

Case studies presented in the article demonstrate the implementation of this system in industrial mineral processing processes. Although the method successfully addresses the issue of unmarked records, it requires a high degree of continuity in industrial systems, which is identified as a limitation.

The work of Ren et al. provides insights into the use of data for predictive quality control in industrial environments. The layered \gls{AI} model and the focus on KPIs are especially relevant for the future development of the system, which can use the analyses carried out over time as training data for the \gls{AI}.

Still within the scope of data storage and big data, Predictive Maintenance (PdM) becomes a very relevant strategy, both in the context of this project and in semiconductor manufacturing, as explained in \cite{susto2015machine}. The article by Susto et al.\cite{susto2015machine} presents a multiple classifier approach to PdM, aiming to minimize downtime and associated costs. Three main categories for maintenance management are identified: Run to Failure, Preventive Maintenance, and Predictive Maintenance. The latter is emphasized for its ability to leverage historical data, forecasting algorithms, statistics, and engineering methods.

The paper uses several trained classification modules with different forecasting horizons to offer various performance trade-offs. Two main indicators are identified to reduce total operational costs: the frequency of unexpected breakdowns and the amount of unutilized lifespan. Linear regression is used as a statistical method for forecasting.

The approach is particularly relevant for systems that require real-time data analysis and efficient data storage, such as industrial sensor monitoring systems. It addresses the limitations associated with the lack of continuous data feed in industrial systems and offers a cost-based decision-making system for maintenance management.

Therefore, the work of Susto et al. provides insights into the application of machine learning for predictive maintenance, especially in semiconductor manufacturing. The methodology can be particularly beneficial for industrial environments where minimizing downtime and operational costs are essential, and could be a logical evolution of this project, given the storage of historical data received in the system that can be used for predictive maintenance.

\section{Real-time Monitoring}

In the context of industrial sensor monitoring and real-time data analysis, the paper by Shafi et al. \cite{shafi2019precision} is relevant as it offers a comprehensive exploration of precision agriculture techniques, with a particular focus on IoT-based intelligent irrigation systems. These systems face similar challenges to those in industrial environments, such as latency, bandwidth limitations, and intermittent internet connectivity.

Edge computing (fog computing), as discussed in the article, emerges as a cutting-edge solution to these challenges. It aims to save energy and bandwidth, reducing failure rates and delays. This is particularly relevant for real-time data analysis and alert systems in industrial sensor monitoring. The Fog of Everything architecture, introduced in the article, offers a multi-layered approach that could be adapted for industrial applications aiming to improve service quality and efficiency in data storage. The methodologies and technologies discussed in the article provide ways of system organization for data storage, big data, and sensor monitoring systems.

The article ~\cite{REHMAN} explores the integration of \gls{BDA} with \gls{IIoT}, focusing on real-time data analysis, data management and storage, aspects that connect with the aim of the dissertation to develop a robust system for monitoring industrial sensors.

The article's discussion on real-time analysis can guide the development of the Data Reception Module, and the data processing module for historical data analysis in this project. In addition, the article's insights on data management and storage can offer paths to optimize the performance of the MongoDB database if necessary.

Although the article does not specifically discuss alert systems, its categorization of analysis techniques into descriptive, prescriptive, predictive, and preventive procedures can provide a framework for generating alerts based on predefined parameters. Moreover, the article's focus on interoperability and integration in IIoT systems may offer guidelines for the effective design and integration of the various modules in this project, such as the Database, Data Receiving Module, and \gls{API}.

An important project to highlight in real-time data monitoring is presented in the article ~\cite{Umakirthika2018}. This extensively explores the use of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies to enhance vehicle safety. The article introduces an \gls{ODAS} System designed to identify obstacles on the road and alert drivers in real-time. The system uses embedded algorithms that detect obstacles based on various vehicle parameters, such as speed and steering angle. Once an obstacle is detected, its location is stored locally and sent to a cloud server periodically. The cloud server processes these data, confirms the presence of a real obstacle, and sends this information back to the vehicle's alert system, which provides audible and visual alerts to the driver.

This article's approach can provide important information for the design and implementation of real-time alert systems in an industrial environment, specifically, the use of IoT for data collection and cloud processing can be adapted to enhance the real-time analysis capabilities of this system. The article also discusses the challenges associated with implementing such a system, including data security and latency, which are important points to consider when transmitting real-time data and generating alerts about machine operation.

In the field of data storage and big data, machine learning algorithms have been widely studied for their ability to analyze and interpret large data sets. A review conducted in \cite{sarker2021machine}, elucidates various statistical and machine learning techniques pertinent to feature selection and data analysis. Methods such as Variance Analysis and Chi-Square tests are highlighted for their utility in identifying statistically significant features in data sets. These techniques are particularly relevant for systems that require real-time data analysis and decision-making, such as industrial sensor monitoring systems.

In addition, the article discusses the application of machine learning algorithms in various areas, potentially including industrial settings and the Internet of Things (IoT). Although the article does not specifically delve into real-time data analysis, the algorithms and methods presented can be adapted for such purposes. For instance, machine learning algorithms can be employed to predict sensor failures or other anomalies based on historical data, thereby enhancing the robustness and reliability of industrial monitoring systems.

In this way, the methodologies and algorithms discussed by Sarker \cite{sarker2021machine} provide guidance for the development of systems that require efficient data storage and real-time analysis capabilities.
