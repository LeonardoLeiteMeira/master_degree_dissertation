\chapter{Tests/Discussion}\label{cap:test}

This chapter presents and describes the tests that were developed to check if the project fulfills the objectives and solves the problem described in Analysis/Methodology.

To better understand, the results of each test should be preceded by a description of the test and the expected results.

The work results are commented, including:

\begin{itemize}
	\item  What can be learned from the results?
	\item What could be done differently? 
	\item What was beyond initial objectives?
	\item What are the objectives there were not met and why?
\end{itemize}
