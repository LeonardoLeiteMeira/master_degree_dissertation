\chapter{Implementation}\label{cap:implementation}

After the chapter where the software architecture was detailed, this chapter is focused on explaining how such architecture was implemented, as while the first describes the structure and organization, this one focuses on the technical actions adopted to make this structure work.

For a more structured and detailed analysis, this chapter has been divided into specific sections for each system component. They are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Database implementation}: This section will address the technical details of the database design and how information is stored and retrieved.
    
    \item \textbf{Implementation of the data receiving module}: This section will detail how data is received, validated, and processed before being stored and made available to users.
    
    \item \textbf{API Implementation}: Here, the structure of the \gls{API} will be discussed, going through some endpoints, the logic behind each one, and the layers used.
    
    \item \textbf{Implementation of the data processing module}: The handling of data received from sensors is addressed, and how the statistical analysis and aggregation that generates the information presented in the charts is done.
    
    \item \textbf{Frontend Implementation}: Finally, the user interface will be discussed, explaining how data is structured and displayed on screen.
\end{itemize}
